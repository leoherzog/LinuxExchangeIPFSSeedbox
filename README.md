# Linux Exchange IPFS Seedbox

### What is this?

[Linux Exchange](https://github.com/leoherzog/LinuxExchange) is a client-side website to download Linux distros peer-to-peer, right in the web browser, via [the Distributed Web](https://ipfs.io/#how). Well, _somebody_ has to be the one who is adding those ISOs to the IPFS network to begin with!

In this repo is a simple Node script that can be run via a [cronjob](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux) to update your local IPFS with the latest distros on Linux Exchange. It assumes that you already have [a local IPFS node](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/) running on your computer.

### I want to help!

Awesome! If you have thoughts about enhancing this code, I'd be happy to review Pull Requests. I'm considering rewriting this in Python someday, but the majority of my work in this project is currently being spent on the Linux Exchange code itself. For now, Node's convenience and built-in handling of JSON made this quick and convenient to build.
